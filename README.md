### Question
We would like you to complete a programming exercise that uses the NASA API(https://api.nasa.gov/) to build a project hosted on GitHub. Specifically, the task is to call the Mars Rover API and select a picture taken on a given day, then download and store each image locally.

## Acceptance Criteria:
The application should pull images for the following dates by reading from a text file:
02/27/17
June 2, 2018
Jul-13-2016
April 31, 2018
The code must be written in TypeScript using Node.js or another server-side JavaScript runtime.
We should be able to build and run the project locally after submission.
Include all relevant documentation (e.g., a README file) in the repository.

## Bonus:
Bonus 1: Display the images in a web browser using React or Svelte.
Bonus 2: Include unit tests, static analysis, performance tests, or any other best practices that align with the definition of "Done."
Bonus 3: Have the application run in Docker.
